# mvpa_processes.py
This file is the code file to perform MVPA analysis referred to my ariticle.
# CBIG_RF_projectMNI2fsaverage
Jianxiao Wu's program that projects MNI152 space data into surface space, which is said better than mri_vol2surf.
# svc_0_023.nii.gz
A mvpa model resulted by 'mvpa_processes.py'
# lh.svc_0_023.allSub_RF_ANTs_MNI152_orig_to_fsaverage.nii.gz
A result generated from that performing CBIG_RFXXX program on svc_0-023.nii.gz.
This result is the weighted coefficients on surface coordinate.
# rh.svc_0_023.allSub_RF_ANTs_MNI152_orig_to_fsaverage.nii.gz
Similar result with lhXXXX.
This is also generated by CBIG_RFXXX program but in right hemisphere.
