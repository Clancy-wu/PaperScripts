<p>The eXtensible Connectivity Pipeline- DCAN (XCP-D) <span class="citation" data-cites="mehta2024xcp mitigating_2018 satterthwaite_2013">(Mehta et al. 2024; Ciric et al. 2018; Satterthwaite et al. 2013)</span> was used to post-process the outputs of <em>fMRIPrep</em> version 24.1.1 <span class="citation" data-cites="esteban2019fmriprep esteban2020analysis">(Esteban et al. 2019, 2020, RRID:SCR_016216)</span>. XCP-D was built with <em>Nipype</em> version 1.8.6 <span class="citation" data-cites="nipype1">(Gorgolewski et al. 2011, RRID:SCR_002502)</span>.</p>
<h4 id="anatomical-data">Anatomical data</h4>
<p>Native-space T1w images were transformed to MNI152NLin2009cAsym space at 1 mm3 resolution.</p>
<h4 id="functional-data">Functional data</h4>
<p>For each of the two BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions), the following post-processing was performed.</p>
<p>Non-steady-state volumes were extracted from the preprocessed confounds and were discarded from both the BOLD data and nuisance regressors. Framewise displacement was calculated from the motion parameters using the formula from <span class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">Power et al. (2014)</span>, with a head radius of 50 mm. Volumes with framewise displacement greater than 0.5 mm were flagged as high-motion outliers for the sake of later censoring <span class="citation" data-cites="power_fd_dvars">(Power et al. 2014)</span>. In total, 36 nuisance regressors were selected from the preprocessing confounds, according to the ‘36P’ strategy. These nuisance regressors included six motion parameters, mean global signal, mean white matter signal, mean cerebrospinal fluid signal with their temporal derivatives, and quadratic expansion of six motion parameters, tissue signals and their temporal derivatives <span class="citation" data-cites="benchmarkp satterthwaite_2013">(Ciric et al. 2017; Satterthwaite et al. 2013)</span>.</p>
<p>The BOLD data were despiked with <em>AFNI</em>’s <em>3dDespike</em>.</p>
<p>Nuisance regressors were regressed from the BOLD data using a denoising method based on <em>Nilearn</em>’s approach. Any volumes censored earlier in the workflow were first cubic spline interpolated in the BOLD data. Outlier volumes at the beginning or end of the time series were replaced with the closest low-motion volume’s values, as cubic spline interpolation can produce extreme extrapolations. The timeseries were band-pass filtered using a(n) second-order Butterworth filter, in order to retain signals between 0.01-0.1 Hz. The same filter was applied to the confounds. The resulting time series were then denoised via linear regression, in which the low-motion volumes from the BOLD time series and confounds were used to calculate parameter estimates, and then the interpolated time series were denoised using the low-motion parameter estimates. The interpolated time series were then censored using the temporal mask. The denoised BOLD was smoothed using <em>Nilearn</em> with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM=6.0 mm).</p>
<p>The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) <span class="citation" data-cites="alff">(Zou et al. 2008)</span> was computed by transforming the mean-centered, standard deviation-normalized, denoised BOLD time series to the frequency domain using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram <span class="citation" data-cites="lomb1976least scargle1982studies townsend2010fast taylorlomb">(Lomb 1976; Scargle 1982; Townsend 2010; Taylor et al. 2018)</span>. The power spectrum was computed within the 0.01-0.1 Hz frequency band and the mean square root of the power spectrum was calculated at each voxel to yield voxel-wise ALFF measures. The resulting ALFF values were then multiplied by the standard deviation of the denoised BOLD time series to retain the original scaling. The ALFF maps were smoothed with Nilearn using a Gaussian kernel (FWHM=6.0 mm). Regional homogeneity (ReHo) <span class="citation" data-cites="jiang2016regional">(Jiang and Zuo 2016)</span> was computed with neighborhood voxels using <em>AFNI</em>’s <em>3dReHo</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="taylor2013fatcat">(Taylor and Saad 2013)</span>.</p>

### Post-processing of fmriprep outputs

The eXtensible Connectivity Pipeline- DCAN (XCP-D)
[@mehta2024xcp;@mitigating_2018;@satterthwaite_2013]
was used to post-process the outputs of *fMRIPrep* version 24.1.1
[@esteban2019fmriprep;@esteban2020analysis, RRID:SCR_016216].
XCP-D was built with *Nipype* version 1.8.6 [@nipype1, RRID:SCR_002502].


#### Anatomical data

Native-space T1w images were transformed to MNI152NLin2009cAsym space at 1 mm3
resolution.


#### Functional data

For each of the two BOLD runs found per subject (across all tasks and sessions),
the following post-processing was performed.

 Non-steady-state volumes were extracted from the preprocessed confounds and were discarded from both the BOLD data and nuisance regressors.  Framewise displacement was calculated from the motion parameters using the formula from @power_fd_dvars, with a head radius of 50 mm. Volumes with framewise displacement greater than 0.5 mm were flagged as high-motion outliers for the sake of later censoring [@power_fd_dvars]. In total, 36 nuisance regressors were selected from the preprocessing confounds,
according to the '36P' strategy.
These nuisance regressors included
six motion parameters, mean global signal, mean white matter signal,
mean cerebrospinal fluid signal with their temporal derivatives,
and quadratic expansion of six motion parameters, tissue signals and
their temporal derivatives [@benchmarkp;@satterthwaite_2013].

The BOLD data were despiked with *AFNI*'s *3dDespike*.

Nuisance regressors were regressed from the BOLD data using a denoising method based on *Nilearn*'s
approach.
Any volumes censored earlier in the workflow were first cubic spline interpolated in the BOLD data. Outlier volumes at the beginning or end of the time series were replaced with the closest low-motion volume's values, as cubic spline interpolation can produce extreme extrapolations. The timeseries were band-pass filtered using a(n) second-order Butterworth filter, in order to retain signals between 0.01-0.1 Hz. The same filter was applied to the confounds. The resulting time series were then denoised via linear regression, in which the low-motion volumes from the BOLD time series and confounds were used to calculate parameter estimates, and then the interpolated time series were denoised using the low-motion parameter estimates. The interpolated time series were then censored using the temporal mask. The denoised BOLD was smoothed using *Nilearn* with a Gaussian kernel (FWHM=6.0 mm).
 
The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) [@alff] was computed by transforming
the mean-centered, standard deviation-normalized, denoised BOLD time series to the frequency
domain using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram [@lomb1976least;@scargle1982studies;@townsend2010fast;@taylorlomb].
The power spectrum was computed within the 0.01-0.1 Hz frequency band and the
mean square root of the power spectrum was calculated at each voxel to yield voxel-wise ALFF
measures.
The resulting ALFF values were then multiplied by the standard deviation of the denoised BOLD time
series to retain the original scaling.
 The ALFF maps were smoothed with Nilearn using a Gaussian kernel (FWHM=6.0 mm).
Regional homogeneity (ReHo) [@jiang2016regional] was computed with neighborhood voxels using
*AFNI*'s *3dReHo* [@taylor2013fatcat].

	abstract = {Several recent reports in large, independent samples have demonstrated the influence of motion artifact on resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsfc-MRI). Standard rsfc-MRI preprocessing typically includes regression of confounding signals and band-pass filtering. However, substantial heterogeneity exists in how these techniques are implemented across studies, and no prior study has examined the effect of differing approaches for the control of motion-induced artifacts. To better understand how in-scanner head motion affects rsfc-MRI data, we describe the spatial, temporal, and spectral characteristics of motion artifacts in a sample of 348 adolescents. Analyses utilize a novel approach for describing head motion on a voxelwise basis. Next, we systematically evaluate the efficacy of a range of confound regression and filtering techniques for the control of motion-induced artifacts. Results reveal that the effectiveness of preprocessing procedures on the control of motion is heterogeneous, and that improved preprocessing provides a substantial benefit beyond typical procedures. These results demonstrate that the effect of motion on rsfc-MRI can be substantially attenuated through improved preprocessing procedures, but not completely removed.},

	abstract = {Current neuroimaging software offer users an incredible opportunity to analyze their data in different ways, with different underlying assumptions. Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: 1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; 2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; 3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; 4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and 5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is BSD licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

Seventy-one BD patients and 113 HC participated in structural and resting-state fMRI scans. Participants ranged in age from 12 to 54 years. All subjects were rated with the Young Mania Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. BD patients showed reduced surface-based ReHo across the cortical surface, both at the global level and in the left ventral visual stream (VVS). Additionally, ReHo value across the cortical surface showed a significant negative correlation with age in both groups at the global level. Abnormal activity in the left VVS cortex may contribute to the pathogenesis of BD. Therefore, surface-based ReHo may be a useful index to explore the pathophysiology of BD.},

	abstract = {A central goal in systems neuroscience is the parcellation of the cerebral cortex into discrete neurobiological "atoms". Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) offers the possibility of in vivo human cortical parcellation. Almost all previous parcellations relied on 1 of 2 approaches. The local gradient approach detects abrupt transitions in functional connectivity patterns. These transitions potentially reflect cortical areal boundaries defined by histology or visuotopic fMRI. By contrast, the global similarity approach clusters similar functional connectivity patterns regardless of spatial proximity, resulting in parcels with homogeneous (similar) rs-fMRI signals. Here, we propose a gradient-weighted Markov Random Field (gwMRF) model integrating local gradient and global similarity approaches. Using task-fMRI and rs-fMRI across diverse acquisition protocols, we found gwMRF parcellations to be more homogeneous than 4 previously published parcellations. Furthermore, gwMRF parcellations agreed with the boundaries of certain cortical areas defined using histology and visuotopic fMRI. Some parcels captured subareal (somatotopic and visuotopic) features that likely reflect distinct computational units within known cortical areas. These results suggest that gwMRF parcellations reveal neurobiologically meaningful features of brain organization and are potentially useful for future applications requiring dimensionality reduction of voxel-wise fMRI data. Multiresolution parcellations generated from 1489 participants are publicly available (https://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG/tree/master/stable\_projects/brain\_parcellation/Schaefer2018\_LocalGlobal).},

	abstract = {Spatial normalization, registration, and segmentation techniques for Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) often use a target or template volume to facilitate processing, take advantage of prior information, and define a common coordinate system for analysis. In the neuroimaging literature, the MNI305 Talairach-like coordinate system is often used as a standard template. However, when studying pediatric populations, variation from the adult brain makes the MNI305 suboptimal for processing brain images of children. Morphological changes occurring during development render the use of age-appropriate templates desirable to reduce potential errors and minimize bias during processing of pediatric data. This paper presents the methods used to create unbiased, age-appropriate MRI atlas templates for pediatric studies that represent the average anatomy for the age range of 4.5–18.5 years, while maintaining a high level of anatomical detail and contrast. The creation of anatomical T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and proton density-weighted templates for specific developmentally important age-ranges, used data derived from the largest epidemiological, representative (healthy and normal) sample of the U.S. population, where each subject was carefully screened for medical and psychiatric factors and characterized using established neuropsychological and behavioral assessments. . Use of these age-specific templates was evaluated by computing average tissue maps for gray matter, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid for each specific age range, and by conducting an exemplar voxel-wise deformation-based morphometry study using 66 young (4.5–6.9 years) participants to demonstrate the benefits of using the age-appropriate templates. The public availability of these atlases/templates will facilitate analysis of pediatric MRI data and enable comparison of results between studies in a common standardized space specific to pediatric research.},

	abstract = {Head motion systematically alters correlations in resting state functional connectivity fMRI (RSFC). In this report we examine impact of motion on signal intensity and RSFC correlations. We find that motion-induced signal changes (1) are often complex and variable waveforms, (2) are often shared across nearly all brain voxels, and (3) often persist more than 10s after motion ceases. These signal changes, both during and after motion, increase observed RSFC correlations in a distance-dependent manner. Motion-related signal changes are not removed by a variety of motion-based regressors, but are effectively reduced by global signal regression. We link several measures of data quality to motion, changes in signal intensity, and changes in RSFC correlations. We demonstrate that improvements in data quality measures during processing may represent cosmetic improvements rather than true correction of the data. We demonstrate a within-subject, censoring-based artifact removal strategy based on volume censoring that reduces group differences due to motion to chance levels. We note conditions under which group-level regressions do and do not correct motion-related effects.},

The MRI data acquired by the HCP differ in many ways from data acquired on conventional 3 Tesla scanners and often require newly developed preprocessing methods. We describe the minimal preprocessing pipelines for structural, functional, and diffusion MRI that were developed by the HCP to accomplish many low level tasks, including spatial artifact/distortion removal, surface generation, cross-modal registration, and alignment to standard space. These pipelines are specially designed to capitalize on the high quality data offered by the HCP. The final standard space makes use of a recently introduced CIFTI file format and the associated grayordinate spatial coordinate system. This allows for combined cortical surface and subcortical volume analyses while reducing the storage and processing requirements for high spatial and temporal resolution data. Here, we provide the minimum image acquisition requirements for the HCP minimal preprocessing pipelines and additional advice for investigators interested in replicating the HCP's acquisition protocols or using these pipelines. Finally, we discuss some potential future improvements to the pipelines.},

Making an accurate areal map has been a century-old objective in neuroscience. Using multi-modal magnetic resonance images from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and an objective semi-automated neuroanatomical approach, we delineated 180 areas per hemisphere bounded by sharp changes in cortical architecture, function, connectivity, and/or topography in a precisely aligned group average of 210 healthy young adults. We characterized 97 new areas and 83 areas previously reported using post-mortem microscopy or other specialized study-specific approaches. To enable automated delineation and identification of these areas in new HCP subjects and in future studies, we trained a machine-learning classifier to recognize the multi-modal ‘fingerprint’ of each cortical area. This classifier detected the presence of 96.6\% of the cortical areas in new subjects, replicated the group parcellation, and could correctly locate areas in individuals with atypical parcellations. The freely available parcellation and classifier will enable substantially improved neuroanatomical precision for studies of the structural and functional organization of human cerebral cortex and its variation across individuals and in development, aging, and disease.},

	abstract = {Most of the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies demonstrated the correlations between spatially distinct brain areas from the perspective of functional connectivity or functional integration. The functional connectivity approaches do not directly provide information of the amplitude of brain activity of each brain region within a network. Alternatively, an index named amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of the resting-state fMRI signal has been suggested to reflect the intensity of regional spontaneous brain activity. However, it has been indicated that the ALFF is also sensitive to the physiological noise. The current study proposed a fractional ALFF (fALFF) approach, i.e., the ratio of power spectrum of low-frequency (0.01-0.08 Hz) to that of the entire frequency range and this approach was tested in two groups of resting-state fMRI data. The results showed that the brain areas within the default mode network including posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral inferior parietal lobule had significantly higher fALFF than the other brain areas. This pattern was consistent with previous neuroimaging results. The non-specific signal components in the cistern areas in resting-state fMRI were significantly suppressed, indicating that the fALFF approach improved the sensitivity and specificity in detecting spontaneous brain activities. Its mechanism and sensitivity to abnormal brain activity should be evaluated in the future studies.},

	abstract = {Several independent studies have demonstrated that small amounts of in-scanner motion systematically bias estimates of resting-state functional connectivity. This confound is of particular importance for studies of neurodevelopment in youth because motion is strongly related to subject age during this period. Critically, the effects of motion on connectivity mimic major findings in neurodevelopmental research, specifically an age-related strengthening of distant connections and weakening of short-range connections. Here, in a sample of 780 subjects ages 8-22, we re-evaluate patterns of change in functional connectivity during adolescent development after rigorously controlling for the confounding influences of motion at both the subject and group levels. We find that motion artifact inflates both overall estimates of age-related change as well as specific distance-related changes in connectivity. When motion is more fully accounted for, the prevalence of age-related change as well as the strength of distance-related effects is substantially reduced. However, age-related changes remain highly significant. In contrast, motion artifact tends to obscure age-related changes in connectivity associated with segregation of functional brain modules; improved preprocessing techniques allow greater sensitivity to detect increased within-module connectivity occurring with development. Finally, we show that subject's age can still be accurately estimated from the multivariate pattern of functional connectivity even while controlling for motion. Taken together, these results indicate that while motion artifact has a marked and heterogeneous impact on estimates of connectivity change during adolescence, functional connectivity remains a valuable phenotype for the study of neurodevelopment.},

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},
