# Mapping the cortical architecture of sleep deprivation: insights from fMRI, neurotransmission, and metabolic activity

## 1. meta-analytic seeds
The seed images we downloaded from Neurosynth platform through the key word "deprivation". 

## 2. preprocessing scripts of rest and task bolds
We used fMRIPrep and XCP-D to process data. Commands were in fmriprep_processes_for_rest+task.html and xcpd_processes_for_rest-bold.html. Then we used Nilearn to process task data. Commands were in fit_glm_for_task-bold.py. 

## 4. association_uniformity_corrp_sig0.001_sscale_weight_hemi-L / R / Both.gii
The cortical dysfunctional map we identified. The value of each vertex was the weight coefficient. 

You are recommended to use this map to start your studies. 

## 5. codes.py
The codes we used in this study, including Lesion brain mapping approach, spatial correlation with transmitters, and Granger causality analysis.
