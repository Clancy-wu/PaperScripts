# Mapping the cortical architecture of sleep deprivation: insights from fMRI, neurotransmission, and metabolic activity

## 1. meta-analytic seeds
The seed images were downloaded from Neurosynth platform through the key word "deprivation". 

## 2. preprocessing scripts of rest and task bolds
We used fMRIPrep and XCP-D to process data. Commands were in fmriprep_processes_for_rest+task.html and xcpd_processes_for_rest-bold.html. Then we used Nilearn to process task data. Commands were in fit_glm_for_task-bold.py. 

## 4. SD-CWM_hemi-L / R / Both.gii
The cortical dysfunction map we identified. The value of each vertex was the weight coefficient. 

You are welcome to use this map on your studies. If so, please cite our article. 

## 5. codes.py
The codes used in this study, including Lesion brain mapping, spatial correlation with neural transmitter receptors, and Granger causality analysis. 

## 6. DAI_LME_analysis.R
The format of computing Directional Asymmetry Index.
